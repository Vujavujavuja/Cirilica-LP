# Lexer-Parser in Cyrillic Project for Programski prevodioci

## Overview
This project is part of the "Programski prevodioci" course at Racunarski Fakultet. It consists of a lexer developed in Java and a parser implemented in Python. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of lexical analysis and parsing in compiler design, and creating a custom programing language.

## Lexer (Java)
The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code. It scans the input characters and classifies them into tokens that are used by the parser for syntax analysis.

## Parser (Python)
The parser takes the tokenized input from the lexer and constructs a parse tree. It checks the source code for syntactic correctness and handles errors gracefully.

## Installation
To start the program you can either choose to run Main.java for just the Lexer part of the project, or run codes.py in python to run both the lexer and parser. Codes are located in javaLexer/ProgramskiPrevodioci1/src/codes and can be edited.
